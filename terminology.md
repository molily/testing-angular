Before we dive in, a quick note regarding the technical terms.

Some words have a special meaning in the context of Angular. In the broader JavaScript context, they have plenty other meanings. This guide tries to distinguish these meanings by using a different letter case.

When referring to core Angular concepts, this guide uses **upper case**:

*Module, Component, Service, Input, Output, Directive, Pipe*, etc.

When using these terms in the general sense, this guide uses **lower case**:

*module, component, service, input, output*, etc.
