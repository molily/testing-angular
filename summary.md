Writing tests is often a frustrating experience that comes on top of implementation troubles. The logical and technical complexity is overwhelming and intimidating. All this drains motivation.

The goal of this guide is to dispel the fear of testing. While testing Angular applications is a complex matter, this guide breaks it down into small, approachable steps and aims to give a well-balanced overview.

Find a testing strategy that reduces the frustration and benefits the quality of your software. Once you have written tests for a couple of features, you will learn which tests are worthwhile – tests that uncover bugs and prevent regressions. Continue with these successes, then slowly explore other kind of tests.

Luckily, the Angular community works steadily to make testing accessible. Angular’s architecture facilitates the testing of all relevant parts. The framework ships with robust testing tools. If they do not fit your needs, there are mature community projects with alternative workflows.

Testing does not only make your software more reliable, but also evolves your coding practice in the long run. It requires to write testable code, and testable code is usually simpler.

Automated software testing is challenging and rewarding for various reasons. Despite all troubles, that makes it fascinating.
